        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <h3>How about Pen Pals?</h3>
        <p>If you have used our service in the past, we have <a href="pen-pal-policy.html">kept the agreement available</a> as an archive for your reference. We cannot contact lost pen pals for you or forge lost connections.</p>
        <p>We no longer match pen pals nor do we have a list of our past pen pal matches. We have a long list of recommended pen pal swaps and other letter writing organizations on our blog post, <a href="https://16sparrows.typepad.com/letterwritersalliance/">Sincerely yours, The L.W.A."</a> that you can use for your letter writing needs.</p>
        <h3>Do you still have ____?</h3>
        <p>We no longer have any stock. We sold or donated everything we had. This includes pigeons and pins.</p>
        <h3>Can I still submit I.R. projects?</h3>
        <p>You can, but we may no longer have your merit badge for your project. Submit it and we will do what we can.</p>
        <h3>What happened to that one download you use to have?</h3>
        <p>We retired many of our downloads when we became an inactive organization. The downloads you see above are all we have available. We do not have the files of any of the other old downloads.</p>
        <h3>Can I still login to my member account?</h3>
        <p>No. We no longer use the platform that held member accounts; this data is no longer active.</p>
        <h3>What about my privacy as a past member?</h3>
        <p>When we were matching pen pals we were very serious about your privacy. We did not and will not share it with anyone other than the pen pals you requested. We did not and will not sell your information or otherwise do anything evil with the information you gave us.</p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <img src="images/D_K_medium.jpg">
        <div>
          <p>The Alliance was started in the Summer of 2007 by Kathy Zadrozny and Donovan Beeson. With a combination of both online presence and in person gatherings we gave folks the tools to maintain the art of letter writing. Donovan and Kathy designed, created, and packaged everything themselves.</p>
          <p>When we started the Alliance our only goal was for people to write more letters. After over a decade, we can safely say that we have achieved that objective. Along the way, we have gained friends, learned about so many different lives, explored new ways to reach out through the postal system, and had a more rewarding experience that just making stationery or greeting cards could ever have given us.</p>

          <div style="clear: both;"/>

          <h3>Our Thoughts on Making Time for Letters</h3>
          <p>Every time you write an e-mail or make a phone call, ask this question, “Is what I have to say to this person worth more than five minutes of my time?” If the answer is yes, then put down that receiver and back away from the monitor. Just because something is quick or free, doesn’t mean it is the best or the most effective way to do it. If you are going to communicate, why not have it be meaningful?</p>
          <p>Letters are the most intimate form of long-distance correspondence we have available. It is a tangible connection between the sender and receiver. One cannot hold an email and marvel at how they are touching the same object that someone else held thousands of miles away. Writing a letter gives one the opportunity to choose their words with care, rather than having to spit them out willy-nilly into the ethereal land of zeroes and ones. A letter is proof of history, an artifact of one’s life and community.</p>
